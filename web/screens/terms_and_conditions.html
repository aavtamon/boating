    <div style="font-size: 16px;">
      It is totally okay to bring infants on board. However, we can NOT provide baby-size life jackets. It is YOUR responsibility to obtain a Coastal Guard approved life jacket.
      <br>
      Please note, that having a life jacket is a must. We will not be able to let an infant onboard without a life vest.
