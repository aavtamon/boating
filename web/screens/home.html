<div id="Home-Screen-Welcome" class="screen-description">
  We are glad to see you here on the boat reservation web site!
  <br>
  You will definitely have a great time on one of our boats.

<div id="Home-Screen" class="screen">
  <div id="Home-Screen-Introduction">
    &nbsp;&nbsp; We are not just yet another place to rent a boat. Unlike others, you can select the pick up / drop off location that is most convenient to you.  You won't have to drive to a marina, navigate thru its complex layout, deal with parking and so on. We will bring the boat to you!
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Our pick up locations are public boat ramps and docks around the lake.  Most of these locations are within public parks, that you may have visited before. Just choose the one that you most comfortable with, and we will meet you there.  You will get the detailed instructions in email or a text message with the name of the rental boat as well as other details that you will need.
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Another ultimate advantage is that we do not charge for fuel at a ridiculous price. You do have an option to refuel the boat at any pump on the lake, but you don't have to spend your time and pay crazy premium. We will charge you for the actual fuel usage at the rate close to what you see at any regular automotive gas station. On average you will save more than a dollar per gallon.</b>

  <div id="Home-Screen-Advantages">
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Rental prices begin at $250.  However, the final figure will depend on the boat you choose, the day of the week, and the duration of your rental.  
    <br>
    We are generally cheaper than other rental facilities. To find the exact rental cost please begin the <a href="#booking_boat">booking process</a>. It will only take a couple of mouse clicks to find out the price for the boat you like.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you are not comfortable driving a boat and need an introduction crash-course we will be happy to provide it to you at no extra cost. We will help you learn some basic boat handling skills before you can go off on your own.

    The lake is a great place to spend your weekend. There are many things that you can do on the lake. You can just enjoy your time on the boat, you can swim in the nice clean warm water, or you can even do water tubing!
    If you want to tube, we will also be happy to provide a tube for you.
    <br>
    Those who like fishing are very welcome, too.
