    If you are a boat owner, and you have a boat in reliable/good condition, we can help you generate additional source of income. 
    <br>
    It is no secret that most boat owners use his/her boat less than 10 times a year.  If this sounds like you, keep on reading.
    <br>
    What we offer is a unique program that is significantly different than other web services looking to lease your boat.  Unlike other sites, we handle finding renters for your boat.  On the day of a rental, we will pick up your boat, deliver it to the renters, and upon conclusion of the rental we will clean and return it to your slip.  You don't need to lift a finger.  You will only need to sign the lease agreement with us. Everything else is on us.
    <br>
    With our convenient web service, you will always know when you boat is rented, and how much you have earned.
    <br>
    You can set it up to receive text notification every time you boat is booked.
    <br>
    Your agreement with us, in no way prevents you from enjoying your own boat.  When you determine that you will need your boat on a particular day(s), visit our web site (via the owner's page), and indicate that the boat is not available for public rental.  Assuming your boat has not already been booked for the days your are interested in,  we will automatically update our web site, and indicate that your boat is not available for public rental.  It is that simple.
