    If you are a boat owner, you have a boat in a good condition, and are looking for an additional source of income, look no further.
    <br>
    It is not a secret that an every boat owner uses his boat less than 10 times a year. Does it sound like you? If so, keep on reading.
    <br>
    What we offer is a unique deal. We are very much different from other web services you can rent with. Unlike others, we do everything for you. You will only need to sign the rental agreement with us. Everything else is on us. We will take the boat when needed, we will rent it out, we will clean it and turn back to the original condition, and will bring it back to the marina. You don't need to lift a finger.
    <br>
    With our convenient web service, you will always know when you boat is rented, and how much you have earned.
    <br>
    You can set it up to receive text notification every time you boat is booked.
    <br>
    Finally, it does not stop you from enjoying your own boat. You just need to plan it a little ahead. You can think you will need your boat on some day, visit this web site, and reserve it for youself! If it is not booked yet, your reservation will remove it from general listing for that particular period that you want to use it. It is that simple.
