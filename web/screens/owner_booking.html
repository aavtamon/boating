    Remember, that after all it is <b>your</b> boat, and you should be able to enjoy it.
    <br>
    We recommend, that when you book your boat for a personal use, you book it for the whole day. This way you can enjoy it fully without having to think that you need to clean and take it back on time, as scheduled.
    <br>
    If, despite this recomendation, you make your reservation for less then a full day, please remember that you must be punctual, be back on time, and strictly follow your contractial agreement.
